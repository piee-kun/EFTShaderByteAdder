# EFTShaderByteAdder
Bypasses a simple file size check on EFT's anti cheat integrity. No shaders to replace are provided.


## what it does
EFT performs a simple file-size check to check if files are correct. If those files are a different file size, e.g if they're modified, the game refuses to launch. This script adds useless bytes at the end of files in a given folder to circumvent said features
